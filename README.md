Hey there! 

## What's This All About?

The goal of this project is pretty simple: I want to get better at using Python to pull data from APIs, and I’m sharing what I’ve learned along the way. In this project, I’ll be:
- Fetching data from public APIs.
- Working with the data that I get back (JSON format).
- Formatting and displaying the data to make it useful.

Note : The intention is to fulfil the requirements from this learning project below,
